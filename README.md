![.](introduction.jpg)

## Introduction

The healthcare industry faces a growing challenge in managing Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) and Accounts Receivable (AR). Efficient cash flow and reimbursement from payers are critical to sustaining high-quality patient care. However, delays in claim processing, denials, and outstanding balances pose risks to the financial stability of hospitals. This document explores an end-to-end data-driven approach to analyzing RCM and AR challenges, utilizing Microsoft Azure,Fabric & Power BI for insights and optimization.

## Problem Statement

The hospital’s financial team observed a declining Net Collection Rate (NCR) and a significant increase in aging AR, particularly claims older than 90 days. The primary concerns included:
•	High claim rejections and denials, leading to lost revenue.
•	Excessive outstanding patient balances, particularly in self-pay accounts.
•	Growing bad debt, with over 25% of billed revenue going uncollected.
•	Delayed collections from key payers such as Medicare and Aetna.
•	Poor visibility into departmental billing performance, impacting financial planning.
