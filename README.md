# Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) & Accounts Receivable (AR) Analysis

![.](introduction.jpg)

## Introduction

The healthcare industry faces a growing challenge in managing Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) and Accounts Receivable (AR). Efficient cash flow and reimbursement from payers are critical to sustaining high-quality patient care. However, delays in claim processing, denials, and outstanding balances pose risks to the financial stability of hospitals. This document explores an end-to-end data-driven approach to analyzing RCM and AR challenges, utilizing Microsoft Azure,Fabric & Power BI for insights and optimization.

## Problem Statement

The hospital‚Äôs financial team observed a declining Net Collection Rate (NCR) and a significant increase in aging AR, particularly claims older than 90 days. The primary concerns included:
-	High claim rejections and denials, leading to lost revenue.
-	Excessive outstanding patient balances, particularly in self-pay accounts.
-	Growing bad debt, with over 25% of billed revenue going uncollected.
-	Delayed collections from key payers such as Medicare and Aetna.
-	Poor visibility into departmental billing performance, impacting financial planning.

## Skills Demonstrated, this project showcases expertise in:
- Data Analytics & Visualization (Power BI, SQL, Excel & Fabric)
- Financial Modeling & KPI Development
- ETL & Data Transformation using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure SQL Database
- Revenue Cycle Optimization
- Business Intelligence Reporting

## Data Sourcing
The analysis is based on structured datasets extracted from hospital financial systems, covering:
- Transaction Data (billing, payments, claim status)
- Patient Information (demographics, payment responsibility)
- Encounter Records (inpatient, outpatient, telemedicine, emergency visits)
- Claims Data (approved, denied, rejected claims, payers)

## Data Transformation
To ensure a clean dataset for analysis, the following data processing steps were applied using Azure Data Factory (ADF) for ingestion and Azure SQL Database for transformation:
-	Data Cleaning: Removed duplicate records, fixed inconsistencies in claim statuses.
-	Standardization: Unified payer names, claim categories, and encounter types.
-	Time-Based Metrics: Calculated Charge Lag, Days in AR, and Aging Buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days).
-	KPI Calculation: Formulated Net Collection Rate (NCR), Bad Debt Rate, Claim Denial Rate, and First Pass Resolution Rate (FPRR).

 ## Modeling

 The data model was structured using Power BI, connecting various relational tables stored in Azure SQL Database:
-	Fact Table: Transactions  
-	Dimension Tables: Patients, Providers, Departments , Encounter & Claims

###	Relationships:
-	Transactions linked to Claims and Patients
-	Transactions linked to Departments & Providers
-	Transactions linked to Calendar and Encounter

## Analysis & Visualization

A series of interactive Power BI dashboards were created to visualize the findings:
1. **Financial Performance Overview**
-	Net Collection Rate (27.38%) ‚Üí Far below industry standard (80-90%), indicating poor revenue recovery.
-	Bad Debt Rate (25.28%) ‚Üí Suggests significant write-offs due to non-payments.
2. **AR Aging Analysis**
-	$3.25M (69.8%) of AR is >90 days old ‚Üí Poses a serious risk of non-collection.
-	Only $0.3M (6.4%) is in the 0-30 days bucket ‚Üí Indicates slow payment processing.
3. **Claim Status Performance**
-	Rejected Claims ($1.04M) & Denied Claims ($0.62M) ‚Üí Over $1.66M in unprocessed revenue.
-	Key Issues: Incorrect coding, missing documentation, late submissions.
4. **AR by Account Type**
-	Self-pay patients contribute 50.09% of AR ‚Üí High risk of non-payment due to financial constraints.
-	Medicare & Aetna owe $1.79M and $1.02M, respectively ‚Üí Need for aggressive follow-up.
5. **AR by Department**
-	_Neurology_ , _Surgery_ , and _Gynecology_  have the highest AR balances.
-	_Dermatology_ has the highest rejection rate, signaling documentation or coding issues.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
---
**Key Findings**:
-	Aging AR is dangerously high (>90 days: $3.25M) ‚Üí Requires immediate intervention.
-	Net Collection Rate (27.38%) is suboptimal ‚Üí Indicating gaps in claim processing and follow-ups.
-	Claim rejections & denials account for significant lost revenue ($1.66M).
-	Bad debt levels (25.28%) are unacceptable ‚Üí Patients are struggling to pay outstanding balances.

## Action Plan for Improvement:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Reduce Aging AR**:
-	Assign dedicated teams to follow up on claims older than 60 days.
-	Implement automated reminders for patient payments.
-	Negotiate faster payment terms with insurance providers.
---

2Ô∏è‚É£**Optimize Claim Submissions**:
-	Implement pre-claims verification to catch errors before submission.
-	Automate claim tracking and resubmit rejections quickly.
---

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhance Patient Collections**:
-	Offer flexible payment plans and financing options for self-pay balances.
-	Increase patient engagement through early billing notifications.
---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Departmental & Payer Focus:
-	Work with Neurology, Surgery, and Gynecology to optimize claim processing.
-	Strengthen relationships with Medicare & Aetna for faster settlements.
---

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Technology & Automation**:
-	Use AI-based predictive analytics to flag potential claim denials.
-	Implement automated AR tracking dashboards for real-time visibility.

By following this structured approach, the hospital can significantly improve cash flow, reduce bad debt, enhance payer relations, and optimize financial sustainability.
